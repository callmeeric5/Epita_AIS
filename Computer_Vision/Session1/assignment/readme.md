# Notebooks are run on Kaggle with G100

## Task -- Notebook

### Documentation 
* Titles are present ✅

* Comments on what is done on each part are present ✅

* Results are commented ✅

### Modelization

* Several models should be tested: ✅
  
   At least one linear and one non-linear
  
   One of them should be a CNN

* A working pipeline is used for training and saved ❌
  
**Explanation:** If setting one notebook A as a script then importing it to another notebook B, kaggle will rerun A casuing 
uncessary computation and train/test data of A need to be reimported as well. Packaging A or write another script for common code 
are not good solutions neither. 

### Performances
* A baseline is defined ✅

* All necessary comparisons are done ✅

* Figures are readable and legends are present ✅

* The number of points for this criteria is weighted by your model performances ✅
