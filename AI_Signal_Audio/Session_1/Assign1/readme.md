# Audio Signal Processing for Bird Sound Isolation

## Objective:

The goal of this project is to analyze an audio recording to identify and isolate the sounds of birds and a plane. This involves plotting time and frequency representations of the signal, applying filtering techniques to isolate the bird sounds, and removing the bird sounds to isolate the plane sounds.

## Analysis and Discussion:

For this assignment, I applied two filters with 3 orders to filter bird and plane sounds from the original audio.
